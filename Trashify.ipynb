        "| `per_device_train_batch_size`, `per_device_eval_batch_size` | `16`, `32` or larger (hardware dependent) | Defines the number of samples passed to our model at one time. For example, if batch size is 16, our model will see 16 samples at a time. It's usually best practice to set this value to the highest your hardware can handle. |\n",
        "| `learning_rate` | `0.0001` (as per the listed papers) | Defines the multiplier on the size of gradient updates during training. Too high and gradients will explode, too low and gradients won't update, both lead to poor training results. The papers mention two different learning rates for the backbone and the detection head, I tried these and got poor results (likely because of our smaller dataset), a single learning rate for the whole network turned out to be better. |\n",
        "| `weight_decay` | `0.0001` (as per the listed papers) | Prevents model weights from getting too large by applying a small decay penalty over time. This prevents a single weight providing too much information. In essence, the model is forced to learn smaller, simpler weights to represent the data. A form of regularization (overfitting prevention). See more at [paperswithcode.com/method/weight-decay](https://paperswithcode.com/method/weight-decay). |\n",
        "| `max_grad_norm` | `0.1` (as per the listed papers) | Prevents gradients from getting too large during training. This will help to ensure stable training. See more at [paperswithcode.com/method/gradient-clipping](https://paperswithcode.com/method/gradient-clipping). |\n",
        "| `num_train_epochs` | `25` (depends on training data and available time) | Defines how many laps of the data your model will do. For example, setting epochs to 25 means the model will do 25 laps of the training data to learn different patterns. In practice, I've found this value to be a good starting point for our dataset and also because we are fine-tuning rather than training from scratch. However, if you had more data you might want to do more epochs (when training from scratch, the papers did 300 epochs). |\n",
        "| `warmup_ratio` | `0.05` | Percentage of total training steps to take learning rate from `0` to to the set value (e.g. `0.0001`). Can help with training stability in the early training steps of the model by not doing too large updates when first starting out. The papers state `2000` warmup steps, however, in practice I found this to be too many for our smaller dataset. |\n",
        "| `dataloader_num_workers` | `4` (hardware dependent) | Number of workers to load data from the CPU to the GPU. Higher is generally better if it is available, however, it can often cap out. Experimentally I've found that `0.5 * os.cpu_count()` generally works well. |\n",

        "2. `requirements.txt` - This text file will include all of the Python packages we need to run our `app.py` file. Before our Space starts to run, all of the packages in this file will be installed.\n",
        "3. `README.md` - This markdown file will include details about our Space as well as specific Space-related metadata (we'll see this later on).\n",

        "2. Define the demo folder we'd like to upload as well as the different parameters for the Hugging Face Space such as repo type (`\"space\"`), our target Space name, the target Space SDK (`\"gradio\"`), our [Hugging Face token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) with write access (optional if it already isn't setup).\n",
        "3. Create a repository on Hugging Face Spaces using the `huggingface_hub.create_repo` method and filling out the appropriate parameters.\n",
        "4. Get the full name of our created repository using the `huggingface_hub.get_full_repo_name` method (we could hard code this but I like to get it programmatically incase things change).\n",
        "5. Upload the contents of our target demo folder (`../demos/trashify_object_detector/`) to Hugging Face Hub with [`huggingface_hub.upload_folder`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/package_reference/hf_api#huggingface_hub.HfApi.upload_folder).\n",
